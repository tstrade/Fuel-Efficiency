Fuel Efficiency Prediction Using Machine Learning
***

This project aims to develop a predictive model for fuel efficiency by calculating miles per gallon (mpg) based on various vehicle characteristics, such as engine displacement, vehicle weight, and horsepower. By leveraging machine learning techniques and publicly available datasets, we will create a regression model that predicts fuel efficiency for gasoline vehicles manufactured from 1996 onwards. The primary datasets utilized for this study are the UCI Auto MPG dataset (Quinlan, 1993) and the Car Specification Dataset 1945-2020 (Islam, 2023). The goal is to provide a reliable tool that can predict fuel efficiency for gasoline vehicles, which can be useful for both manufacturers and consumers.
