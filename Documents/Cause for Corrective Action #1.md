Fuel Efficiency Prediction Using Machine Learning
***
## Summary

This project aims to develop a predictive model for fuel efficiency by calculating miles per gallon (mpg) based on various vehicle characteristics, such as engine displacement, vehicle weight, and horsepower. By leveraging machine learning techniques and publicly available datasets, we will create a regression model that predicts fuel efficiency for gasoline vehicles manufactured from 1996 onwards. The primary datasets utilized for this study are the UCI Auto MPG dataset (Quinlan, 1993) and the Car Specification Dataset 1945-2020 (Islam, 2023). The goal is to provide a reliable tool that can predict fuel efficiency for gasoline vehicles, which can be useful for both manufacturers and consumers.

## Introduction

Fuel efficiency is a critical factor in the automotive industry, impacting both economic and environmental concerns. With growing interest in reducing carbon emissions and improving fuel economy, understanding the factors that affect a vehicle’s mpg is essential for consumers, manufacturers, and policymakers. Machine learning offers an opportunity to build data-driven models that can accurately predict fuel efficiency based on vehicle specifications. This project seeks to leverage machine learning to predict fuel efficiency using widely available automotive datasets.

## Background

Fuel efficiency plays an essential role in the design of vehicles. Its importance has recently grown due to environmental regulations and the desire to reduce environmental damage. Various factors, including engine displacement, vehicle weight, and horsepower, influence a car's fuel efficiency. Traditional approaches to predicting MPG, such as linear regression, offer basic insights, but machine learning techniques can significantly improve accuracy by accounting for non-linear relationships between variables. There have also been other models that also predicts mpg, but they focus on an older dataset while this project focuses on the modern era of vehicles. This project will employ 2 datasets to enhance model performance: the Auto MPG dataset and the Car Specification Dataset 1945-2020.  The volume of these datasets will help both test and train the model.

## Roles and Responsibilities 

#### Project Lead:  
The project lead will oversee the entire project, ensuring that all team members are aligned and that the project stays on schedule. They will coordinate meetings, manage deadlines, and provide strategic direction for the project's timely completion. The project lead will also ensure that all deliverables are met according to the project plan.

#### Data Architects:  
The data architects are responsible for acquiring, cleaning, and organizing the datasets. They will ensure the data is consistent before handing it off for model development. They will design and implement the functions needed for efficient data processing, and manage the storage and version control of both the raw and processed data.

#### Data Scientists:  
The data scientists will focus on analyzing the datasets and developing the machine learning model. They will split the data into training and testing sets, select appropriate algorithms, and evaluate model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-squared. They will also perform hyperparameter tuning and optimize the model to increase prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

#### Communication Liaison:  
The communication liaison will be responsible for maintaining clear and consistent communication between all stakeholders, including the team and any external collaborators or advisors. They will provide updates on the project’s progress, ensure that all members are informed of changes or issues, and manage any required presentations or reports.

#### Scribe:  
The scribe will document all key discussions, decisions, and action items during team meetings. They will maintain organized records of meeting notes, deliverables, and any changes to the project plan. The scribe will also assist the communication liaison by preparing reports and summaries for stakeholders/sponsors.

## Plan of Action

The Plan of Action for this project begins with data collection and preparation. The data architects will be responsible for acquiring and preprocessing the datasets. These include the Auto MPG dataset (Quinlan, 1993) and the Car Specification Dataset 1945-2020 (Islam, 2023). The project will focus on vehicles manufactured after 1996, as this reflects advancements in automotive technology and emissions standards like OBD-II, which was introduced that year. Once the data is collected, the architects will clean and organize the information, ensuring that the dataset is of high quality. Afterward, the data will be split into training and testing sets, allowing for robust model development and evaluation.

Once the data is prepared, the model selection and training phase will commence. The data scientists will lead this effort, implementing Random Forest Regression as the primary model due to its capacity to handle non-linear relationships and reduce the risk of overfitting. The training data will be used to build the model, while the testing data will evaluate the model's ability to generalize beyond the training set. Throughout this process, the data scientists will ensure that the model is fine-tuned, optimizing hyperparameters to maximize predictive accuracy.

In the final stage, the team will focus on model evaluation. The performance of the model will be assessed using key metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²). These metrics will provide insight into how well the model predicts fuel efficiency. Additionally, the data scientists will make adjustments based on the evaluation results, while the data architects ensure the scalability of the model and its potential integration with future datasets. This comprehensive approach will ensure a reliable and accurate model for predicting vehicle fuel efficiency.

## Schedule

#### Schedule for Each Role

The project lead will oversee the entire development of the predictive model for fuel efficiency, starting with the proposal and continuing throughout the project. They will present and finalize the proposal while managing progression between milestones and coordinating the team during the model development phase.

The data architect is responsible for collecting and observing data, and gathering data for model training and testing while ensuring its usability for analysis. Following data collection, the architect will focus on cleaning the data and preparing it for machine learning applications.

The data scientist will lead the implementation of the Random Forest Regression model, integrating the cleaned dataset into the model. They will then work on optimizing the model for accuracy, fine-tuning it to maximize its accuracy. After optimization, the data scientist will evaluate the model's performance using the following metrics: RMSE, MAE, and R².

Throughout the project, the communication liaison will communicate between team members, and provide updates to stakeholders/sponsors regarding project progress, including any delays or risks. The scribe will document decisions made to model and the dataset. They will make sure that each team member is aligned with the project milestones and has clearly defined responsibilities related to the project's progress.
